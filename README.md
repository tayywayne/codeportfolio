# 🌙 My Developer Portfolio 🌙

Welcome to my developer portfolio, a space I built to showcase who I am as a developer, what I’ve worked on, and where I’m headed.

This portfolio is built with React, animated using Framer Motion, and includes a custom Day/Night mode toggle written in vanilla JavaScript. I wanted the site to feel alive, responsive, and true to my personality, and this project was the perfect chance to bring that vision to life.

### ✨ What You'll Find ✨

* A clean and responsive layout built from scratch that works great on both desktop and mobile.
* Subtle, smooth animations powered by Framer Motion.
* A fully functional Dark/Light Mode toggle, built from scratch with JavaScript + React + Web Storage API.
* Modular, readable code.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack 🛠️

Here's what I used under the hood:
* React - For building the UI with reusable components.
* Framer Motion - For adding animations.
* JavaScript - For theme logic and interactivity.
* CSS - For styling, fully written by me.
* Netlify - For hosting to the web!

### 🌗 Theme Toggle 🌗
One feature I’m especially proud of is the Day/Night mode toggle. I didn’t want to rely on external libraries, so I wrote it myself using React state and Web Storage API for offline persistence to remember your preference.
It's a small detail, but one that reflects how I approach user experience: thoughtful, subtle, and intentional.
